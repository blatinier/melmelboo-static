<p>We know that first impressions are important, so we've populated your new site with some initial <strong>Getting Started</strong> posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!</p>
<h3 id="thereareafewthingsthatyoushouldknowupfront">There are a few things that you should know up-front:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so <strong>does</strong> require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the best experience we recommend downloading the <a href="https://ghost.org/downloads/">Ghost Desktop App</a> for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing">Ghost(Pro)</a> service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.</p>
<p>The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/the-editor/">the Ghost editor</a>.</p>
<p>Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default <strong>Ghost</strong> user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!</p>

<p>When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a <strong>?</strong> icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.</p>
<p>For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.</p>
<h2 id="formattingtext">Formatting text</h2>
<p>The most common shortcuts are of course, <strong>bold</strong> text, <em>italic</em> text, and <a href="https://example.com">hyperlinks</a>. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + B</code> for Bold</li>
<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + I</code> for Italic</li>
<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + K</code> for a Link</li>
<li><code>CMD/Ctrl + H</code> for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.</p>
<h2 id="insertingimages">Inserting images</h2>
<p>Images in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:</p>
<p><code>![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)</code></p>
<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/computer.jpg" alt="Using the Ghost editor"></p>
<p>Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.</p>
<p><em><strong>Important Note:</strong> Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files <strong>before</strong> uploading them to Ghost.</em></p>
<h2 id="makinglists">Making lists</h2>
<p>Lists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use <code>*</code> or <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>. Like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Crack the eggs over a bowl</li>
<li>Whisk them together</li>
<li>Make an omelette</li>
</ol>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember to buy milk</li>
<li>Feed the cat</li>
<li>Come up with idea for next story</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="addingquotes">Adding quotes</h2>
<p>When you want to pull out a particularly good excerpt in the middle of a piece, you can use <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.</p>
<h2 id="dividingthingsup">Dividing things up</h2>
<p>If you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping <code>---</code> on a new line will create a sleek divider, anywhere you want it.</p>

<p>This should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/advanced-markdown/">Advanced Markdown Guide</a> - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/using-tags/">how to use Ghost tags</a>.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p>
<h2 id="basictagging">Basic tagging</h2>
<p>When you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with <code>News</code> and other posts with <code>Cycling</code>, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/cycling/</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Cycling</code> - then it appears in both sections.</p>
<p>Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p>
<h2 id="theprimarytag">The primary tag</h2>
<p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.</p>
<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme Sports</mark></p>
<p>In this example, <strong>News</strong> is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.</p>
<h2 id="privatetags">Private tags</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p>
<p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p>
<p><mark><strong>News</strong>, Cycling, #video</mark></p>
<p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of <code>News</code>, and <code>Cycling</code> - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with <code>#video</code>.</p>
<p>In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:</p>
<pre><code>{{#post}}
    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}
        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...
    {{else}}
        ...regular markup for a post...
    {{/has}}
{{/post}}
</code></pre>
<p>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive <a href="https://themes.ghost.org/">theme documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="authors">Authors</h3>
<p>The base user level in Ghost is an author. Authors can write posts, edit their own posts, and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, you shouldn't invite them to Ghost admin.</p>
<h3 id="editors">Editors</h3>
<p>Editors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new authors to the site.</p>
<h3 id="administrators">Administrators</h3>
<p>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.</p>
<h3 id="theowner">The Owner</h3>
<p>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable — for example, billing details, if using Ghost(Pro).</p>
<hr>
<p>It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</p>

<p>If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because it's not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a simple shared pass-phrase.</p>
<p>You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost's General Settings</p>
<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png" alt="Making your site private"></p>
<p>Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it. While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep the site off the radar.</p>
<p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for very basic privacy.</p>

<p>If you've gotten pretty comfortable with <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/the-editor/">all the basics</a> of writing in Ghost, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown!</p>
<p>As with the last post about the editor, you'll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we're using.</p>
<h2 id="specialformatting">Special formatting</h2>
<p>As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>strike through</s></li>
<li><mark>highlight</mark></li>
<li>*escaped characters*</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="writingcodeblocks">Writing code blocks</h2>
<p>There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, <code>like this</code>. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:</p>
<pre><code>.my-link {
    text-decoration: underline;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using <a href="http://prismjs.com/">Prism.js</a>.</p>
<h2 id="fullbleedimages">Full bleed images</h2>
<p>One neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a <code>#hash</code> value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:</p>
<p><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full" alt="Advanced Markdown tips"></p>
<p>which is styled with...</p>
<pre><code>img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {
    max-width: 100vw;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.</p>
<h2 id="referencelists">Reference lists</h2>
<p><strong>The quick brown <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox" title="Wikipedia: Fox">fox</a>, jumped over the lazy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="Wikipedia: Dog">dog</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.</p>
<h2 id="creatingfootnotes">Creating footnotes</h2>
<p>The quick brown fox<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> jumped over the lazy dog<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.</p>
<h2 id="fullhtml">Full HTML</h2>
<p>Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<hr class="footnotes-sep">
<section class="footnotes">
<ol class="footnotes-list">
<li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>Foxes are red <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn2" class="footnote-item"><p>Dogs are usually not red <a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Ghost comes with a beautiful default theme called Casper, which is designed to be a clean, readable publication layout and can be easily adapted for most purposes. However, Ghost can also be completely themed to suit your needs. Rather than just giving you a few basic settings which act as a poor proxy for code, we just let you write code.</p>
<p>There are a huge range of both free and premium pre-built themes which you can get from the <a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org">Ghost Theme Marketplace</a>, or you can simply create your own from scratch.</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.ghost.org"><img src="https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/marketplace.jpg" alt="Setting up your own Ghost theme"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone can write a completely custom Ghost theme, with just some solid knowledge of HTML and CSS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ghost themes are written with a templating language called handlebars, which has a bunch of dynamic helpers to insert your data into template files. Like <code>{{author.name}}</code>, for example, outputs the name of the current author.</p>
<p>The best way to learn how to write your own Ghost theme is to have a look at <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper">the source code for Casper</a>, which is heavily commented and should give you a sense of how everything fits together.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>default.hbs</code> is the main template file, all contexts will load inside this file unless specifically told to use a different template.</li>
<li><code>post.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing a post.</li>
<li><code>index.hbs</code> is the file used in the context of viewing the home page.</li>
<li>and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>We've got <a href="http://themes.ghost.org/docs/about">full and extensive theme documentation</a> which outlines every template file, context and helper that you can use.</p>
<p>If you want to chat with other people making Ghost themes to get any advice or help, there's also a <strong>#themes</strong> channel in our <a href="https://slack.ghost.org">public Slack community</a> which we always recommend joining!</p>

<p>Le Petit Chaperon Rouge, ce conte indémodable que nous adorons mais qui picotte toujours un peu nos yeux de parents. Nous vous proposons de lire la version originale en bas versus la version revisitée des Colette en haut. Nous nous sommes bien amusées à retravailler ce texte emblématique tout en essayant de rester fidèle à son esprit !</p>
<p>Notre objectif ? Réécrire l'histoire telle que nous souhaiterions pouvoir la lire à nos enfants afin de leur transmettre des valeurs qui nous sont précieuses. Nous voulons arrêter de véhiculer dans leur inconscient les valeurs patriarcales dépassées de l'ancien monde et nous avons à coeur de leur proposer une vision du monde plus inclusive. Virer le sexisme, élargir les représentations en rendant visible des minorités, sortir les animaux des stéréotypes gentile/méchant, proposer une version éco-féministe au maximum inclusive... Ce projet nous enchante ! Et il ne fait que commencer. Est-ce que l'idée te plait ? Esgt-ce qu'une version revisitée du Petit Chaperon Rouge de Grimm vous tente avant de passer à un autre conte ?</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">La plage du serpent</h2>
<p>Mercredi - 12h15 - Je rentre d'une session de courses pour ravitailler notre famille.</p>
<p>&quot;Allez hop hop hop ! Vous enfilez vos manteaux, vos écharpes et vos botes ! On file manger un pique-nique à la plage tous les trois pour laisser papa travailler tranquile cet après midi !&quot;<br>
&quot;OUAIIIIIIS !!!&quot;</p>
<p>Les enfants sont ravis, Benoît aussi, il va pouvoir bosser en télé-travail dans un silence confortable arès une matinée avec nos deux loulous. Moi j'ai un sourire jusqu'aux oreilles car je leur réserve une surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Vous avez attaché vos ceintures ? Prêts au décollage ? Aujourd'hui nous allons sur une plage ou vit un immeeeeense serpent de mer...&quot;<br>
&quot;Un serpent ?!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oui. Un serpent. IMMENSE !&quot;<br>
&quot;On va aller le voir pour de vrai ?!!!!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oui... Pour de vrai. Il est plus grand que toi et toi et moi et papa réunis. Il est immeeeense. Et nous allons aller manger sur sa plage.&quot;<br>
&quot;Mais... Il est carnivore ? Il est grand grand grand VRAIMENT ? Ça veut dire qu'il peut nous manger ?&quot;<br>
&quot;Hum. À votre avis ?&quot;</p>
<p>Et nous voilà en route ! Moi surexitée, avec ma voix mystérieuse, je retrouve mes réflexes de maîtresse qui doit entraîner son aditoire avec elle dans l'aventure. Eux ? Ils me pressent de question, la tenson monte, Gaspard est inquiet tandis que Charlie tente de comprendre où est le truc... On arrive bientôt près de la plage. La voiture est garée, nous sortons avec le sac plein de victuailles.</p>
<p>Gaspard s'accroche très fort à ma main. Il n'a plus très envie d'y aller. Les serpents immenses et peut-être carnivore c'est effrayant, même lorsque maman précise que c'est un serpent de mer, qui vit exclusivement dans l'eau. De son côté, Charlie est excitée comme une puce, elle se demande encore de quoi il s'agit exactement... car un serpent immense, hum... ça sent l'arnaque, y'a un truc qui cloche dans ton histoire maman !</p>
<p>Nous nous engageons sur le chemin qui mène à la plage. Charlie trottine tout près de moi, pas folle la guèpe, sait on jamais ! Gaspard, lui, commence vraiment à avor la trouille. Plus qu'un pas et on y est. Ouille ouille ouille ! Courage !</p>
<p>Il est là, dans toute sa majeté ! L'immense sculpture représentant un squelette de serpent émerge des vagues à mesure que la marée descend. Charlie s'exclame qu'il est magnifique ! Gaspard rit de soulagement ! Nous courront jusqu'à lui et nous installons à quelques pas pour dévorer notre repas. Il fait froid mais beau. Le temps idéal pour un pique-nique d'hiver... en charmante compagnie :D</p>

<p><em>PS : Si vous voulez l'appercevoir, il se trouve sur une des plages de Saint Brévin Les pins. Je n'ai pas eu le courage de parcourir le distance nécessaire pour prendre une photographie de la bête en entier. On y retournera à l'occasion !</em></p>
<p><em>rePS : Évidement on a ramassé quelques déchets. C'est devenu un réflexe pour les enfants à la plage, au parc, dans la rue... merci les inconscients, les j'men foutistes, les pêcheurs, les touristes, les poubelles qui débordent. Et merci -vraiment- à tous ceux qui jours après jours se lancent dans un mode de vie qui tend vers le zéro déchet :)</em></p>

<p>Après un long voyage en voiture, train, avion, taxi... Nous voilà arrivé à Hanoï de bon matin !!!! OUF ! Nous sommes épuisés mais terriblement heureux de découvrir enfin ce pays longtemps rêvé.</p>
<p>Dehors il fait chaud. Très chaud. Dans le véhicule il fait frais, climatisation oblige. Benoît monte à l'avant et moi à l'arrière avec Gaspard et Charlie. Gaspard grimpe sur mes genoux, je serre fort la main de Charlie dont les yeux brillent d'excitation. C'est si émouvant d'être ici avec eux ! Je mesure ma chance. Nous nous éloignons de l'aéroport pour traverser la campagne verdoyante, j'observe les rizières avec avidité pour ne pas en perdre une miette. C'est émouvant d'apercevoir des silhouettes travailler les pieds dans l'eau, sous leur chapeau pointu. Image si emblématique du Vietnam !</p>
<p>Quelques voitures se frayent un passage au milieu des scooters de plus en plus nombreux. Ils sont bientôt une multitude à envahir l'espace. Nous nous enfonçons dans les rues de plus en plus étroites de Hanoï. Et le taxi nous dépose devant l'hôtel que nous avons repéré sur le guide du routard pendant le trajet. Situé en plein coeur du vieux centre, il nous semble idéal pour débuter ce séjour en fanfare !!</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Ouf ! On y est !</h2>
<p>&quot;Vous aurez les clés en début d'après-midi !&quot;</p>
<p>Ouille !Nous qui rêvions d'une douche et d'une bonne sieste... Nous laissons nos bagages à l'hôtel et partons découvrir Hanoï en famille ! Priorité numéro une : MAN-GER ! Dehors il fait une chaleur lourde et moite, nous dégoulinons jusqu'au bout du nez. Les scooters envahissent les trottoirs, les restaurants se succèdent ... Nous dégotons finalement un petit boui boui où nous goûtons notre première spécialité vietnamienne. Huuum ! Bonheur !!! Puis nous nous baladons dans le vieux quartier, au gré de nos envies. Le nombre incroyable de scooters nous impressionne, il y en a vraiment partout sur la route et sur les trottoirs. En parents un peu stressés nous serrons fort les mains de nos enfants. Le bruit, la fatigue, la chaleur... Nous sommes tous épuisés. Il est temps de rentrer.</p>
<p>Nous découvrons notre chambre avec plaisir ! Fenêtre avec vue sur un mur, une grande spécialité au Vietnam :D En vrai on s'y sent bien malgré l'absence de lumière naturelle. De toute manière on s'en fiche. Nous nous débarrassons de nos vêtements en deux temps trois mouvements et filons sous la douche ! Froide. Mais qu'importe, c'est si bon ! Nous nous effondrons ensuite pour une sieste qui nous entraîne jusqu'au soir. La climatisation nous fait un peu culpabiliser mais c'est certainement en partie grâce à elle que nous dormons comme des bébés !</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Bonne nuit !</h2>
<p>Allez zou ! Debout ! Nous filons découvrir Hanoï by night et manger un bout au milieu du trottoir ! Ici les restaurants n'ont pas souvent de salle intérieure, ils cuisinent dans la rue et font parfois la vaisselle à même le sol dans des bassines. Alors à l'heure des repas, les restaurateurs installent des petites tables et des petits tabourets pour leurs clients. Une fois n'est pas coutume, nous nous régalons de nouilles sautés !</p>
<p>Et là, le DRAME ! Benoît et moi réalisons que nous avons oublié en France nos pailles et nos gobelets réutilisables. Dans le pays du jus de fruit frais ! OUILLE ! Il est hors de question pour nous de céder à l'appel du tout jetable mais pas question non plus de passer à côté de ces délicieuses spécialités locales ! Nous souhaitons conserver au maximum nos habitudes végétariennes et zéro déchet en voyage. Du moins, autant que faire se peut. Alors nous nous mettons en quête d'une boutique où nous pourrions trouver ces trésors. AU fil de notre balade diurne nous trouvons notre bonheur dans une rue où la plupart des boutiques vendent des équipements de cuisine en inox. Dans le vieux quartier chaque rue regroupe un corps de métier différent, comme dans la France du Moyen-Age. Bref ! Nous repartons avec deux gobelets en métal et quatre pailles que l'on inaugure sur le champ avec un délicieux jus de fruit de la passion pressé à par un marchand ambulant. La fraicheur du soir nous fait du bien après une longue, très longue journée éprouvante !</p>
<p>Et puis nous rentrons à l'hôtel ! Et commençons à remplir nos carnets de voyage, dénichés dans une jolie boutique de papeterie :)</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Deuxième jour</h2>
<p>Une bonne nuit de sommeil plus tard et nous sommes frais comme des gardons ! Nous prenons un gros petit déjeuner sur la terrasse de l'hôtel située sur son toit, le seul endroit agréablement frais de Hanoï :D Je goûte pour la première fois des fruits de la passion et me découvre... une nouvelle passion ! Un vrai délice qui m'accompagnera pendant un mois. Huuuuum !!</p>
<p>Et puis nous partons à l'assaut de la ville. Les enfants sont courageux et marchent des kilomètres. La sucette glissée par Mamisa dans leur sac à dos est d'un grand réconfort lorsque leurs jambes fatiguent et que le moral flanche. Nos épaules deviennent leurs meilleures amies et après cette grosse journée de vadrouille sous un soleil impitoyable, nous sommes ravis d'avoir emporté notre porte-bébé qui nous sauve la mise. Nous buvons un jus de fruit par là, un autre par ci. Les enfants découvrent qu'ils sont une attraction pour certains locaux, pour le moment ça les amuse. Petit à petit nous apprivoisons cette ville et notre quartier si dense, si bruyant (vraiment très très bruyant), si vivant.</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Troisième jour !</h2>
<p>On ne change pas une équipe qui gagne ! Pour bien commencer la journée rien ne vaut une terrasse presque fraîche sur le toit et une multitude de fruits de la passion accompagnés de petites crêpes. MIAM !</p>
<p>Parsemez le tout de câlin et vous voilà prêt à entamer cette journée du bon pied. Au fait, j'insiste sur le &quot;presque fraîche&quot;. N'oubliez JAMAIS qu'il fait TOUJOURS très chaud pendant ce voyage. La moindre brise, pluie, ombre... est la bienvenue :)</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Et c'est reparti !</h2>
<p>Je vous raconte les scooters partout ? Les coqs dans les arbres, les pauvres oiseaux en cage ? La chaleur moite ? Le bruit ? Les odeurs ? Les déchets un peu partout ? La fierté dans ses yeux lorsqu'il arrive à manger avec des baguettes ? Les gens ? Les tortues vivantes servant d'offrande dans ce temple ? les pieds douloureux de trop marcher ? Les épaules en compotes à force de porter ? Les yeux qui brillent de toutes ses découvertes ? La saveur d'un jus de fruit frais lorsqu'on se pose à bout de souffle ? Les jeux des enfants dans la rue ? La tempête, l'orage, la pluie qui s'abat sans prévenir et que l'on accueille avec soulagement ? La dernière douche froide ? La dernière nuit ? La tété du presque matin ? La première banane ? Et puis le départ si tôt vers un nouvel ailleurs... Mais  pour aller où ?</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">La terreur</h2>
<p>Et puis PAF ! Une crise d'éco-anxiété m'est tombée sur le coin du nez avec le lundi de la rentrée. Savoir que 2020 est une année charnière d'après le <a href="https://leclimatchange.fr/">GIEC</a> en ce qui concerne l'écologie et voir que hors de mon cocon rien ne semblait avoir changé m'a tétanisé. Les images de l'Australie en flammes m'ont littéralement assommée et la colère m'a submergée. J'étais triste, j'ai pleuré. J'étais en colère, j'ai eu envie de hurler. J'ai eu envie de tout casser, d'aller me terrer dans un coin, j'ai eu peur, si peur de l'avenir !</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">La lutte</h2>
<p>Je me sentais impuissante et inutile. Déprimée. Au fond du trou. Et puis j'ai vu passer cet appel au don de poches en tissu pour les marsupiaux rescapés des incendies, relayé par une association de refuges australiens. Manon et moi ayant les compétences nécessaires pour coudre les dites poches nous avons tout de suite décidé de financer une petite production sur les fonds de <a hrf="http://www.etpuiscolette.fr">et puis Colette</a>. On avait pasla tête à coudre des furoshiki. Ça nous semblait si dérisoire. Et puis quitte à couper du tissu nous nous sommes dit que nous avions les moyens d'en produire beaucoup plus en donnant de notre temps. Il nous manquait juste l'argent nécessaire pour payer les couturier.e.s qui travaillent à nos côtés. Alors, sur <a href="https://www.instagram.com/etpuiscolette/">Instagram</a> nous avons proposé aux Colette de nous aider à financer notre action. En une soirée nous avions récolté 1500€, deux jours plus tard nous avions 2400€ en notre possession. Je vous passe les détails mais les jours qui ont suivi l'appel aux dons ont été d'une intensité incroyable ! Je n'ai pas beaucoup dormis ! J'ai dû répondre à des centaines de messages, trouver des solutions techniques aux problèmes rencontrés, prendre contact avec un refuge australien, expliquer les enjeux et faire le lien entre les Colette et le refuge avec lequel nous travaillons, organiser la réception de pochettes confectionnés par des couturières bénévoles, par des élèves et leurs enseignant.e.s... Tout ça pendant que Manon gérait la production d'une première fournée de poches ! Bref. On a pas chaumé !</p>
<p>Pourquoi je vous raconte ça ? Cet engagement humanitaire tombé du ciel m'a tout simplement permis de sortir de mon état de colère et d'anxiété très intense. En l'espace d'une journée je suis passée d'un état de stupeur à un état d'action qui m'a fait beaucoup de bien. Je ne dis pas que c'est simple, notre engagement va nous demander encore beaucoup de travail mais PUTAIN QUE C'EST BON DE SE SENTIR UTILE !</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">L'espoir</h2>
<p>Voici trois jours que le cours de nos vies a retrouvé un rythme plus raisonnable. Aujourd'hui j'ai passé la journée à me promener au bord de la mer avec les enfants. Je me sens heureuse et sereine. Légère. Je n'aurais pas cru cela possible il y a une semaine ! Sereine... Pas pour notre avenir qui s'annonce bien sombre, je n'ai plus beaucoup d'espoir quand je vois la lenteur avec laquelle les individus, les états, les entreprises, s'engagent dans une démarche écologique de décroissance. Mais sereine car je fais ma part un peu plus chaque année. Il reste tant à faire dans notre vie mais mon militantisme me permet de transformer mes angoisses et ma colère en quelque chose de positif et d'utile. Je ne changerais pas le monde à moi toute seule c'est sûr ! Et je ne suis certainement pas exemplaire. Mais agir me permet de garder le cap et de retrouver le sourire envers et contre tout. Informer, soutenir, militer. Militer. Encore et encore. À mon échelle. Tu sais... les colibris. À nous tous rien n'est impossible ! Enfin... j'espère...</p>

Nous avons eu le plaisir d'observer des ragondins dans la prairié, le marécage, dans l'eau... un peu partout. Il faisait froid, les cookies étaient bons, les enfants on fait du vélo (Charlie a envie d'apprendre en ce moment). Bref c'était chouette ! Le village est super mignon, la balade est magnifique. Et nous avons enchaîné sur une soirée douillette tous les sept. C'était parfait ! Et vous ?</p>
<p>BONNE ANNÉE !</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">La lumière de nos journées d'hiver</h2>
<p>Du blanc de meudon en déco sur les vitres ; on trouve facilement cette poudre en boutique bio, mélangé à un peu d'eau ça donne une peinture écolo qui se nettoie en un clin d'oeil. La déco de nos années folles, celle rapportée de nos voyages et celle chinée ces derniers mois au fil des brocantes. Les lumières chaleureuse de nos guirlandes. Une couronne de lierre du jardin confectionnée à six mains. Notre éternel calendrier de l'Avent (j'en parle déjà <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/art-notre-calendrier-de-l-avent-839/">ici</a> lorsque Charlie était minuscule, <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/zero-dechet-le-calendrier-de-lavent/">ici</a> juste avant notre départ en voyage, <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/noel-au-soleil/">là</a> dans le salar de Uyuni en Bolivie ou <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/cest-noel-a-la-maison/">là</a> pour notre premier Noêl à la jolie guinguette). Le sapin en palette prêté par des copains. Des sapins en carton, partout. Quelques étoiles dans notre ciel. Les mendiants qu'on cuisine avec les Charlie et Gaspard. Les cadeaux pour nos proches emballés en famille dans <a href="https://www.etpuiscolette.fr/">nos furoshiki et puis Colette</a>. Les chats qui ronronnent. Bref. Depuis que l'isolation de l'étage est terminée, la vie est de nouveau douce à la jolie guinguette !</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Le choix des composteurs</h2>
<p>Depuis janvier dernier, nous avons retiré les toilettes à eau de notre maison pour nous lancer dans l'aventure des toilettes sèches. Après un grand voyage en famille dans notre camping-car, Baloo, où nous avions utilisé quotidiennement <a href="https://www.melmelboo-voyage.fr/blog/des-toilettes-seches-en-camping-car/">des toilettes sèches</a> (je vous expliquais notre fonctionnement <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/post-post/">dans un vlog</a>), nous n'imaginions plus fonctionner autrement ! Quel soulagement le jour où nous nous sommes enfin lancé après quelques mois d'autres travaux prioritaires dans la maison ! Et depuis, aucun regret, vraiment !</p>
<p>Après vous avoir présenté <a href="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/zero-dechet-les-toilettes-seches/">nos toilettes sèches</a> dans un article il y a quelques mois, je vous avais dit que je laisserais passer les beaux jours avant de faire un point sur notre compost de toilettes sèche. Nous souhaitions laisser passer les fortes chaleurs afin de pouvoir évoquer le cas des odeurs avec le recul de l'expérience. C'est la grande peur d'une majorité des gens si j'en crois vos questions ici et sur <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hellomelmelboo/">Instagram</a> :D</p>
<p>Mais laissez-moi d'abord vous présenter nos composteurs ! Après avoir longtemp imaginé fabriquer un joli composteur en bois de palettes, nous avons finalement dû nous résoudre à l'évidence : notre tas de compost grossissait à vue d'oeil entre trois palettes disgracieuses et les travaux de la maison ne nous laissaient pas le temps ni le courage de nous lancer dans une chouette fabrication à base de récup. Nous avons donc prospecté sur internet afin de trouver trois contenants adaptés à nos besoins et c'est vers <a href="https://www.lecopot.com/compostage/71-pack-3-composteurs-toilette-seche-3200-litres.html">l'entreprise l'écopot</a> que nous nous sommes tourné : trois composteurs au design simple et efficace, une production française à base de bois français, une équipe disponible et un site plein de bons conseils pour se lancer, le tout pour une valeur de 750€. Parfait ! Ayant décidé d'être leur cliente, je les contacte pour leur proposer un partenariat, ils nous offrent 30% de réduction sur notre facture en échange d'un article de blog. Sans aucune contrainte, juste un retour honnête d'expérience. J'accepte avec grand plaisir :)</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Mon avis sur les composteurs l'écopot</h2>
<p>Quelques semaines plus tard nous recevons un ensemble de trois composteurs <a href="https://www.lecopot.com/compostage/71-pack-3-composteurs-toilette-seche-3200-litres.html">L'écopot</a> pensés pour une famille de quatre personnes. Spécialement conçus pour l'usage des toilettes sèches, ils sont parfaitement adaptés à nos besoins. Premier constat : ils sont beaux ! Nous les montons en deux temps trois mouvements dans le poulailler de Poulette et Cocotte (qui sont le plus souvent en liberté dans le jardin) et transvasons notre compost existant dans le premier bac de 1200L. D'ici quelques mois nous retransvaserons ce tas de compost de l'année dans notre second composteur de 1200L afin d'aérer le compost pour lui permettre une meilleure décomposition. Puis nous le laisserons reposer une année supplémentaire avant de le transvaser à nouveau dans le troisième composteur de 800L où il finira de mûrir tranquillement. À terme nous utiliserons donc le premier bac dans lequel nous vidons systématiquement nos toilettes sèches tout au long de l'année, le second bac dans lequel reposera le compost pendant un an après avoir été transvasé, le troisième bac dans lequel le compost finira de vieillir un an de plus avant de pouvoir être utilisé dans le jardin. C'est dans ce troisième composteur que nous vidons actuellement notre compost quotidien de fruits, légumes et petites tailles du jardin.</p>
<h2 class="sub-title">Le cas des odeurs</h2>
<p>Nous vidons en moyenne nos toilettes sèches tous les six jours. C'est Benoît qui s'en charge systématiquement car une fois plein, le seau de 30L est trop lourd pour moi. Nous ne regrettons pas ce choix car ça permet d'espacer la &quot;corvées de chiotte&quot; mais c'est une donnée à prendre en compte en choisissant la taille du seau ! Après quelques mois de flottement et de test nous avons fini par trouver une scierie qui nous fournit en sciure de bonne qualité qui sent boooon le bois frais ! (Merci <a href="https://mumacontrecourant.com/">mum à contrecourant</a> pour la bonne adresse !) Un bonheur à utiliser au quotidien, promis nos toilettes sentent bon ! Nous n'étions pas chez nous pendant la canicule car nous étions au Vietnam mais nous n'avons jamais eu de problème particulier d'odeur sauf lorsque les enfants oublient de verser de la sciure après leur passage ou lorsque nous n'en mettons pas assez entre chaque passage. Il suffit d'ajouter une poignée de sciure pour rétablir l'équilibre azote/carbone et y remédier. Verser suffisamment de sciure sur le pipi et le caca, c'est le secret infaillible pour des toilettes sèches agréables au quotidien !</p>
<p>Concernant l'odeur au niveau des composteurs <a href="https://www.lecopot.com/compostage/71-pack-3-composteurs-toilette-seche-3200-litres.html">L'écopot</a>... franchement... sauf si j'ouvre le composteur et que je mets la tête dedans il n'y a vraiment RIEN à signaler. J'ai déjà été renifler, mon nez à dix centimètres du couvercle par journée de forte chaleur pour vérifier (oui oui je prends mon rôle de testeuse au sérieux !!) lorsque je peignais le feuillage noir sur le mur. Vraiment, il n'y a pas de problème d'odeur, même lorsqu'on passe à côté du composteur. Prochaine étape : transvaser le contenu du composteur numéro un au composteur numéro deux ! On verra si c'est une étape longue, fatigante, puante... ou si ça passe crème ! Je reviendrais vers vous avec mes impressions d'ici quelques mois :D</p>

<h2 class="sub-title">Les vagues de grand-père</h2>
<img src="https://www.melmelboo.fr/blog/content/images/2019/10/planche-a-voile01.JPG" alt="La valse du vent !"><p>Mercredi dernier nous avons bravé le mauvais temps pour aller voir grand-père. Mon papa. Et sa GRANDE passion à mon papa, d'aussi loin que je me souvienne, c'est la planche à voile ! Charlie rêve d'apprendre à faire de la planche à voile avec son grand-père. Elle attend ce jour avec impatience ! Elle sait que d'abord il faudra apprendre à nager, à mettre la tête sous l'eau sans peur... elle sait que le chemin sera long et peut-être difficile. Mais pour le moment, elle en rêve fort ! Malgré le vent, malgré la pluie.</p>
<p>Alors quand elle a su qu'on irait voir le naviguer dans la tempête après manger, elle était ravie ! On a enfilé les mentaux et les écharpes et on est descendu sur la plage. Gaspard et Charlie ont observé leur grand-père prendre les vagues bouche bé, ils ont crié pour l'encourager et ont frissonné de concert lorsque le vent s'est calmé et à fait coucher sa voile. PLOUF ! Dans l'eau ! La pluie s'est mise à tomber encore plus fort et le vent s'est fait la malle. Grand-père a remballé sa planche à voile, un câlin, un dernier bisou mouillé, et nous avons repris la route direction la maison. Trempés... mais surtout contents comme des poux !</p>
